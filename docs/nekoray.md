# Nekoray

Before we begin, note that there are two installation options depending on your needs:

- If you only need the proxy to work in a browser, any version of Nekoray will do.
- If you need to proxy specific applications, we recommend using versions 3.24 or 3.25.

This is because in version 3.26, the "Whitelist Mode" in Tun Mode settings does not work. As a result, you wonâ€™t be able to proxy only specific applications.
